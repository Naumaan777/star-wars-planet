# Star Wars Planets Directory üåå

## Overview üìñ

My mission - choose to accept it, involves the creation of a web application that showcases planets from the Star Wars universe using the Star Wars API (SWAPI). This directory will not only feature information about each planet but also list its notable residents. This work will demonstrate my proficiency in API integration, frontend development, and your ability to produce a responsive and stylish user interface. Star Wars Planets Directory is a ReactJS project that showcases the planets and residents of the Star Wars movies. Importantly this project has development with react as an assignment for Aquera.

The deployed site without an internal JSON Server can be found here.

## About üåê

Star Wars Planets Directory is a web application that showcases planets from the Star Wars universe using the Star Wars API (SWAPI).

## Getting Started with Create React App üöÄ

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

In the project directory, you can run several commands:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm run eject`: Removes the single build dependency from your project.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
